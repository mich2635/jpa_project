SPRING

ANNOTATIONS 
	@SpringBootApplocatoin
	@Controller
	@Repository
	@Service

IMPORTANT NOTES
	If we use different packages in Spring,It wont recognoze 
the coded in that packages..to do that we need to scan the packages 
with @ComponentScan(PACKAGE NAME) Annotation

	If the class is Entity class the spring wont recognize the package
Eventhough we use spring annotation ..In order to scan the entity class we need 
to use @EntityScan() Annotation instead of @ComponentScan annotations

AOP - ASSPECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

	In this concept the AOP Annotated methods will be called before or after 
The actual method call happens ..We can also call this methods after the exception 
throws

SPRING BOOT 
	Spring boot was discovered to replace the servlet to reduce the codes
Using Spring boot we can create MVC Application and REST application,
Using REST API we can easily create code independent front end and back end codes

JPA - Java Persistent API

	Developers biggest difficulties is to write query bases programms and 
to match the datatype of the data in the program with the datatype in database.
To simplify this JPA is used 
	By using JPA The table is automatically created based on the annotations
which makes the developing life easoer
	The more important thing is JPA automaticallu opens and closes the connection
to the database
